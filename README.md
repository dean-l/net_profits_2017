Net Profits is a fully interactive virtual fish pond, that gives students an exciting incentive to perform well in class. The installation allows studentâ€™s to do a variety of activities, such as throwing tokens into the pond, feeding the fish, and cleaning the pond. Each of these interactions use physical objects in some way, and the pond will depict real time feedback in turn to create an experience that simulates an actual fish pond.

Net profits revolves around the token system, a way of rewarding students who perform well in class. These tokens can be thrown into the pond to unlock ways to interact with the fish. Students can either shake fish food into the pond, or pour in cleaning solution. The more tokens students use in one go, the more they can use these resources. The installation uses colour tracking from an overhead mounted camera to detect the tokens and the containers and registers these in the system.

The installation utilises a permeable screen that allows the coins to pass through while acting as a screen to show a projected pond image. This is designed to give the impression of the pond surface and highlight the interactions with the pond by concealing the technical aspects of the project. Feedback is provided to the user through projected ripples when a token lands in th pond and a food sprinkling animation and sound effect when the food container is used.

Overtime, students will be able to see how their actions affect the ecosystem for the better. We truly believe the connection between the students and Net Profits, will be the driving factor for them to perform better in class
